- 👋 Hi, I’m @judejoshua
- 👀 I’m interested in product design, mentoring and front-end development.
- 🌱 I have experience in React.js, Solidjs, Nextjs, Vue.js and html/css. I also have experience in PHP and Laravel as I have used them in the past to collaborate on some fullstack development projects. Currently, I am learning Flutter to aid my understanding of mobile app development.
