- 👋 Hi, I am Jude Joshua.
- 👀 I am interested in product design, mentoring, and front-end development.
- 🌱 I have experience in front-end development with React.js, Solidjs, Next.js, and Vue.js. Additionally, I know about back-end development using PHP and Laravel, which I have utilized in collaborating on full-stack projects. Currently, I am learning Flutter to enhance my understanding of mobile app development.
- 💞️ I am interested in collaborating on projects that allow me to innovate, guide and motivate teams towards achieving shared goals, particularly in environments that value autonomy and purpose.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email at thejudejoshua@gmail.com.
